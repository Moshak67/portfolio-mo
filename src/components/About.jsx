            While studying Multimedia, I discovered my love for coding in a plot
            twist that changed everything. I realized that my creative mindset
            and attention to detail perfectly aligned with the world of
            programming. Determined to pursue this newfound passion, I continued
            my education in computer science.

            I thrive on creating innovative solutions that not only meet
            functional requirements but also deliver an exceptional user
            experience. As a front-end specialist, I enjoy crafting visually
            appealing and interactive interfaces. But don't let that fool you!
            I'm equally proficient in back-end development and skilled in
            database design, particularly with relational databases like MySQL.

            Outside of coding, I embrace my artistic side by using code as my
            canvas. It's my way of blending creativity and technology to create
            captivating digital art. I approach problem-solving with a strategic
            and analytical mindset, always seeking optimal solutions.

            every project is what drives me.
